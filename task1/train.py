In the modified code, parts regarding attention penalty, which was specific to the previous self-attention model configuration, have been removed because they are not relevant to the current task. Such modifications were made in the `train_model` function and reflected in the `enumerate(dataloader['train'])` loop. Consequently, the inputs to the forward pass of the model were updated, and now, annotation matrices are not expected. Notably, this is a general modification and will work regardless of the format of the "Combined_Dataset" Google Sheets file. In other words, the training function is now better adapted to handle datasets of different formats and structures. Additionally, the call to the `evaluate_dev_set` function in the `train_model` function had the same modifications.
